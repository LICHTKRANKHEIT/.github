# LICHTKRANKHEIT

[한국어](README.md) / **English** 


## About Us
**LICHTKRANKHEIT** operates on a unique **decentralized model**. Instead of a rigid hierarchy, we're comprised of numerous **autonomous sub-groups**. Each sub-group is identified by a unique numerical code (e.g., `101`, `102`, `201`, `203`, etc.), signifying its independent activity within our collective.

LICHTKRANKHEIT itself doesn't have a specific goal. Our primary purpose is solely to **support the autonomous goal-setting and achievement of our numbered sub-teams**.

> [!TIP]
> **Each team's goals aren't limited to just development.**
> For instance:
> - Team `303` operates a repository called '**Sketchbook**,' aiming to upload all sorts of information (e.g., politics, games, general knowledge, etc.).
> - Team `501` is nicknamed '**Lounge**' and focuses on fostering fellowship and free communication rather than development.
>
> This flexibility allows each team to pursue the direction best suited to its unique characteristics and needs.

This structure enables:

* **Autonomy:** Each sub-group is free to define its own goals, choose its tech stack, and manage its projects independently.
* **Specialization:** Sub-groups can focus on niche areas, fostering expertise and innovative solutions.
* **Collaboration:** While independent, sub-groups are encouraged to collaborate, share knowledge, and exchange ideas.
